# tweepy functionality
[installation](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.9.0/install.html)

Using tweepy, we can write scripts to do practically any interaction avilable on twitter. Notably, we can:

    1) compose and send tweets
    2) like and retweet other tweets 
    3) search for and follow accounts

When combined with python, we can leverage outside information (files) to
process PySAL/CGS information/news into tweet format and drive engagement for
the PySAL community.

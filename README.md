# twitter and text processing

## twitter
This repository will be used to make functions that consume text and process text into drafts on twitter. The idea being that a "superuser" can log into twitter's draft page, edit the tweets if necesssary, and send. 

Alternatively, we can utilize twitter's API and the CGS Linode server to automate a schedule of tweets. 

## text processing
In the process of creating the 'black box,' functions should be written in a way that maximizes their usability and reusability. See `tasks.ipynb' to itterate on what tasks the box can perform.
